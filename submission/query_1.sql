/*

De-dupe Query (query_1.sql)
Write a query to de-duplicate the nba_game_details table from the day 1 lab of the fact modeling week 2 so there are no duplicate values.

You should de-dupe based on the combination of game_id, team_id and player_id, since a player cannot have more than 1 entry per game.

Feel free to take the first value here.

    -- Subqueries:
    --     today: Selects records from alia.user_devices_cumulated for January 9, 2023.
    --     date_list_int: Calculates a numeric representation (history_int) for each user's activity over the past week (from January 2 to January 9, 2023). Each dayâ€™s activity is encoded as a power of 2 if the user was active that day.

    -- Main Query:
    --     Selects all columns from date_list_int.
    --     Converts history_int to a binary string (history_in_binary).
    --     Defines weekly_base as a binary string representing activity across 7 days.
    --     Counts the number of days the user was active in the past week (num_days_active).
